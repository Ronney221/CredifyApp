(The Platinum Card also offers Global Entry/TSA PreCheck reimbursement (up to $100 every 4–5 years) and an optional SoulCycle at-home bike credit ($300 each, up to 15 times/year), but these are either non-recurring or one-off perks and thus not listed as a recurring benefit.)
American Express Gold Card

thepointsguy.com

thepointsguy.com
. Simply use the Gold Card at one of these merchants, and a $10 statement credit will post that month (if you spend at least $10). Unused monthly credits do not carry over. (Mobile App: Grubhub or others – e.g., order via Grubhub app to use the credit; ensure Gold Card is the payment method.)
Resy Dining Credit: $50 credit every 6 months (Jan–Jun and Jul–Dec; $100 total annually). Instructions: New in 2024.

You’ll automatically receive up to $50 in statement credits twice per year (once in each half of the calendar year) for dining purchases at Resy-booked restaurants
thepointsguy.com
. No special reservation or code is required; however, the restaurant must be a Resy participant and the charge must code as a restaurant. Be mindful of the timing: one $50 credit is available in H1 and another in H2. (Mobile App: Resy – optional for finding/booking restaurants, but credit posts via Amex after dining.)
Dunkin’ Credit: $7 credit every 1 month (total $84/year). Instructions: New in 2024. Enroll your Gold Card for the Dunkin’ benefit. Use it to make purchases at Dunkin’ Donuts in the U.S., and you’ll get a $7 statement credit each month (when you spend at least $7)
thepointsguy.com
. This essentially covers up to $7 of your Dunkin’ spend monthly. Unused amounts don’t roll over. (Mobile App: Dunkin’ – you can add your Gold Card in the Dunkin’ app for easy use; the credit will appear on your statement after the purchase.)
(Amex Gold also earns monthly Uber Cash of $10, which is the same Uber benefit listed above – we’ve listed it as “Uber Cash Credit.” The Gold card’s new Resy and Dunkin’ credits introduced in 2024 increased its annual fee but give cardmembers more value

awardwallet.com
thepointsguy.com
. Current Green cardholders will no longer receive LoungeBuddy credits. (Going forward, Green card perks center on the CLEAR credit and the card’s points-earning features.)
(Aside from the CLEAR credit, the Amex Green Card’s recurring benefits are limited. It does still offer the Global Entry/TSA PreCheck $100 credit every 4 years and 3x points on travel and dining, but no monthly/annual statement credits beyond CLEAR as of 2025.)
American Express Blue Cash Preferred Card
Disney Bundle Credit: $7 credit every 1 month (total $84/year). Instructions: Enroll your Blue Cash Preferred (BCP) and use it to pay for the Disney Bundle (which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+). Each month that you spend $9.99 or more on a Disney Bundle subscription with your BCP, you’ll receive a $7 statement credit
americanexpress.com
. This effectively subsidizes the bundle cost (e.g. standard bundle ~$13.99, or ad-supported ~$9.99) by $7 each month. Credits post monthly after the charge; unused credit doesn’t carry over. (Mobile App: Disney+ / Hulu – ensure the BCP is the payment method for the subscription.)
(Note: $84/year is the maximum via 12×$7 credits. BCP’s other perks are cash back rewards; this Disney Bundle credit is its only recurring statement credit perk

doctorofcredit.com
. This $300 credit applies to a broad range of travel expenses (airfare, hotels, car rentals, cruises, taxis, public transit, parking, tolls, etc.) and is applied in real time (your transactions will get credited back until you hit $300)
frequentmiler.com
. It resets every January. No activation required; it’s an automatic benefit that significantly offsets the card’s annual fee.
DoorDash Credits: $5 credit every 1 month on DoorDash (restaurant orders). Instructions: Enroll for the complimentary DashPass membership (free with Reserve through 2027). As a Sapphire Reserve cardholder, you get $5 off one DoorDash restaurant order each month when paying with the Reserve card
chase.com
joinkudos.com

Lyft Credit: $10 credit every 1 month (through Sept 2027). Instructions: Add your Sapphire Reserve as the payment method in the Lyft app. From April 1, 2025 through 9/30/2027, Reserve cardmembers receive a $10 in-app Lyft ride credit each month
lyft.com
lyft.com
. The credit appears in your Lyft account automatically (usually labeled as an “Amp” or Chase credit) and is applied to your next ride(s) each month. Unused monthly Lyft credits expire at month’s end. In addition, you earn 5x points on Lyft rides with Reserve during this period
lyft.com
. (Mobile App: Lyft – credit is applied via the Lyft app; no manual activation needed beyond adding your card.)
Instacart Benefits: (Expired)* $15 Instacart Monthly Credit – Note: The prior Instacart+ membership and $15/month Instacart credit for Reserve cardholders ended in July 2024
reddit.com
. However, starting May 2025, Chase expanded Instacart benefits to many co-branded cards; the Sapphire Reserve is not currently included in the new Instacart credit rollout (it focuses on co-brands and business cards)
joinkudos.com
joinkudos.com
. Reserve holders still get Instacart benefits like 1-year Instacart+ membership (offer may vary) but no ongoing monthly Instacart credit in 2025.
(The Sapphire Reserve also provides a Priority Pass lounge membership and perks like Global Entry/TSA fee credit every 4 years, but those are not monthly/annual credits. The core recurring perks are the $300 travel credit and the new DoorDash/Lyft credits which together add value each month

Chase Sapphire Preferred
Hotel Credit: $50 credit every 12 months (cardmember year). Instructions: Each account anniversary year, you get a $50 statement credit for hotel stays booked via the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal
katiestraveltricks.com
. To use it, simply book a hotel through Chase Travel using your Sapphire Preferred; the first $50 of hotel charges will be automatically refunded. This credit resets every account anniversary (not calendar year).
DoorDash Credits: $10 credit every 1 month on DoorDash (grocery/retail pickup orders). Instructions: Like the Reserve, the Sapphire Preferred comes with free DashPass through 2027. Preferred cardmembers get a $10 monthly DoorDash credit, but for non-restaurant purchases (e.g. grocery stores, convenience stores, DashMart, etc.)
katiestraveltricks.com
katiestraveltricks.com
. Use your Preferred card with DashPass activated; you’ll see a $10 off promo automatically for eligible non-restaurant orders each month. The credit is split into one $10 use per month and does not roll over
katiestraveltricks.com
katiestraveltricks.com
. (Restaurant orders on Preferred do not get a monthly credit, only non-food orders do.) (Mobile App: DoorDash – ensure DashPass is active with Preferred; the $10 promo will apply to a grocery/retail order in-app.)
Instacart Benefits: Preferred cardholders currently receive a free Instacart+ membership (6 months) and (starting May 2025) may receive monthly Instacart credits as part of Chase’s expanded partnership. Specifically, many Chase cards now get $10 per month in Instacart credits through 2027
joinkudos.com
. (If the Sapphire Preferred is included, it would be $10/month – check your Chase offers in 2025). Always activate the Instacart benefit via the Chase link and add your card to Instacart to use the credits. (Mobile App: Instacart – add Preferred as payment; credits typically appear in your Instacart account each month.)
(The Sapphire Preferred’s new DoorDash credit (introduced Aug 2024) effectively gives $120/year in value if fully used
katiestraveltricks.com
. It also retains a 5x points on Lyft rides (through Sept 2027) but no monthly Lyft credit for Preferred. The $50 hotel credit is straightforward and encourages using Chase’s portal for bookings.)
Capital One Venture X
Travel Credit: $300 credit every 12 months (cardmember year). Instructions: Use your Venture X to book travel through the Capital One Travel portal – you have up to $300 per year in credits to offset those bookings
capitalone.com
. At checkout in Capital One Travel, you can apply the credit to your booking; it can be used in part or full across multiple bookings until $300 is reached
capitalone.com
. This credit resets on your account anniversary each year (expires if not used by then). It effectively makes using the Capital One Travel site a must for the first $300 in bookings, significantly offsetting the $395 annual fee
thepointsguy.com
. (No separate app; use Capital One’s website or Travel portal. The credit is integrated into the booking process.)
Anniversary Bonus: Not a statement credit, but worth noting – every account anniversary, Venture X awards 10,000 bonus miles (≈$100 in travel value). While not a redeemable statement credit, it’s a recurring value item.
(Venture X does not have monthly credits, but the easy-to-use $300 annual travel credit and anniversary points are key recurring benefits
thepointsguy.com
.)
(Capital One Venture, the lower-tier card, does not have recurring credits aside from a Global Entry/TSA fee credit. The Venture X’s $300 credit is unique to it among Capital One personal cards.)
Bank of America Premium Rewards Card
Airline Incidental Credit: $100 credit every 12 months (calendar year). Instructions: Use your Premium Rewards card to pay for qualifying airline incidental fees (checked baggage, seat selection fees, lounge passes, onboard food, etc.) and you’ll receive up to $100 in automatic statement credits per year
bankofamerica.com
thepointsguy.com
. The credit applies to any airline’s incidental charges (not airfare). No enrollment needed; credits post usually within a week of an eligible charge until you hit $100 for the year. This benefit is per calendar year (Jan–Dec).
(This $100 credit can effectively cancel out the card’s $95 annual fee
nerdwallet.com
. The card also provides a Global Entry/TSA credit every 4 years, but no other monthly/annual credits.)
Bank of America Premium Rewards Elite Card
Airline Incidental Credits: $300 credit every 12 months (calendar year). Instructions: The Elite card provides up to $300 annually in airline incidental fee credits – this includes charges like seat upgrades, baggage fees, airline lounge memberships, etc., but not airfare
thepointsguy.com
. Use the card for qualifying airline fees and you’ll be reimbursed automatically, up to $300 per year (resets each calendar year). It works similarly to the $100 credit on the regular Premium Rewards, just with a higher limit.
Lifestyle Convenience Credits: $150 credit every 12 months (calendar year). Instructions: The Elite card also offers up to $150 annually in statement credits for “lifestyle” expenses
thepointsguy.com
. Covered categories include ride-hailing, streaming services, food delivery, and fitness subscriptions
privatebank.bankofamerica.com
thepointsguy.com
. Essentially, when you use the card for things like your monthly streaming subscriptions, Uber/Lyft rides, food delivery (e.g. DoorDash, Grubhub), or gym/fitness memberships, those charges will trigger credits until you’ve accumulated $150 back for the year. This resets each calendar year. (No enrollment required; credits post automatically as eligible transactions occur.)
(These two credits total $450/year if fully used, helping offset the Elite’s $550 annual fee. The card also has a Global Entry/TSA credit every 4 years and Priority Pass, but those are not annual credits.)
U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite
Travel/Dining Credit: $325 credit every 12 months (cardmember year). Instructions: This card automatically reimburses up to $325 per year in combined travel and dining purchases
nerdwallet.com
. Simply use the Altitude Reserve for any travel expenses (airlines, hotels, rental cars, taxis, etc.) or dining expenses (restaurants, takeout, food delivery). Charges in those categories will be credited back to your statement until you’ve accumulated $325 in credits each year
nerdwallet.com
. The credit operates on your membership year (based on account opening date) and resets each year on that date. It’s very flexible – essentially any restaurant or travel charge qualifies, and the credit posts automatically (usually within days of the charge).
(This generous $325 credit effectively reduces the net cost of the card’s $400 annual fee to $75 if maximized
reddit.com
. The Altitude Reserve also offers an application fee credit for Global Entry/TSA PreCheck every 4 years, but no monthly recurring credits. Note: As of late 2024, the Altitude Reserve is not accepting new applicants
nerdwallet.com
, but existing cardholders retain these benefits.)
Citi Prestige Card (Legacy)
Travel Credit: $250 credit every 12 months (calendar year). Instructions: Prestige cardholders receive up to $250 in statement credits for travel purchases each year
thepointsguy.com
. Any purchase that codes as travel (flights, hotels, travel agencies, parking, Uber/Lyft, etc.) will be automatically reimbursed until you hit $250 for the year
thepointsguy.com
. No activation needed; the credit resets every Jan 1.
(Important: The Citi Prestige is no longer open to new applicants (discontinued), but existing cardmembers still get this annual $250 travel credit. Citi expanded the credit in past years to temporarily include dining and supermarkets, but it remains broadly useful on travel
