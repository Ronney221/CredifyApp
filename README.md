## What is Credify? ü§î

Do you have multiple credit cards, each with a unique set of perks like monthly dining credits, travel bonuses, or subscription rebates? It can be challenging to keep track of them all, leading to missed opportunities and lost value.

Credify simplifies this by:

*   Allowing you to select your credit cards from a pre-populated list (Amex Gold, Chase Sapphire Reserve, Amex Platinum, and many more!).
*   Displaying all associated perks in an easy-to-navigate dashboard.
*   Helping you track the redemption status of each perk ('available', 'pending', 'redeemed').
*   Providing deep-linking capabilities to quickly open the relevant merchant app or website to redeem your perk.
*   Motivating you with gamification features like redemption streaks and progress tracking.
*   Sending timely notifications for monthly perk resets and upcoming card renewal dates.

## Project Status üöß

This project is currently at a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage, demonstrating core functionality. Future enhancements are planned as outlined in the `todo.md` file, including full backend integration for data persistence and user accounts.

## Getting Started (Development) üßë‚Äçüíª

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (or `yarn install`)

2.  **Start the Expo development server:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    Follow the prompts to open the app in an iOS simulator, Android emulator, or on a physical device using the Expo Go app (for features not requiring native builds) or a development build.

3.  **To run on a specific platform with native capabilities (recommended for full feature testing):**
    ```bash
    npx expo run:ios
    # or
    npx expo run:android
    ```
