### **Update: Version 2.0 Features - Official App Store Launch (Released 7/20/2025)**

This major release marks Credify's official App Store launch with significant new features and a complete UI overhaul for a premium user experience.

üöÄ **New Features**
* **Redemption Tips & Hacks:** Unlock the full potential of your perks! Every perk now features a series of tips and hacks, showing you clever strategies that power users employ to maximize their redemptions.
* **Multi-Card Deletion:** Managing your wallet is now easier. You can now select and delete multiple cards at once from the card management screen.
* **'All' Time Filter:** An "All" tab has been added to the time period filters (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y) in the insights section, allowing you to see your complete redemption history at once.
* **Categorized App Shortcuts:** To help you redeem faster, buttons to open partner apps are now grouped into logical categories (e.g., "Open Streaming Apps," "Open Dining Apps"), each with its own distinct color and icon.
* **Delete Account:** As part of our commitment to your privacy and in adherence with iOS guidelines, you can now delete your account directly from the app.
* **Annual Fee Counter:** When selecting your cards during onboarding, you'll now see a running total of the annual fees, helping you understand the value you're getting from your perks.

‚ú® **UI/UX & Core Functionality Improvements**
* **Updated Swipe-to-Log Functionality:** We've changed the swipe-right gesture on perks. Instead of simply marking a perk as fully redeemed, you now have the flexibility to log either a partial or the full redemption amount directly.
* **Complete UI Overhaul:** The app has a stunning new look! We've redesigned major screens with a modern and premium feel, including:
  * **Icons for Every Perk:** Every single perk now has its own unique icon, making it easier to identify and visually distinguish them at a glance.
  * **Glassmorphism Effects:** See-through, blurry backgrounds on cards and other elements for a sleek, modern aesthetic.
  * **Redesigned Profile & Dashboard:** A cleaner layout with a larger avatar, better-organized sections, a new hero balance card, and subtle animations.
* **New Tutorial Experience:** The one-time pop-up tutorial is gone! We've replaced it with a much clearer, more comprehensive preview overlay that you can access anytime by tapping the "Replay Tutorial" button in your Profile.
* **More Intuitive Insights:** Your monthly summaries in the Insights tab are now easier to understand. We've also fixed spacing issues to ensure a consistent and clean look across different screen sizes.
* **Enhanced "Edit Profile" Screen:** The "Edit Profile" screen is much more user-friendly. Key improvements include a fix for the save confirmation button, which is no longer hidden behind the keyboard.
* **Value-Weighted Progress Bar:** The progress bar for your perks now visually represents the value of each perk, giving you a more accurate picture of your redemption progress.
* **Improved Animations & Interactions:** We've polished animations throughout the app for a smoother, more responsive experience, including satisfying button taps, smoother screen transitions, and enhanced haptic feedback.
* **iMessage-Style Swiping:** Swiping on perks now has a limited distance, similar to the iMessage app, for a more controlled and polished interaction.
* **Clearer Messaging & Design:** We've updated language and visuals across the app, including adding partner logos, implementing a consistent design system, and ensuring clearer messages about your redemption status.

üêõ **Bug Fixes & Performance Improvements**
* **Historical Perk Logic Fixed:** We've corrected an issue where the expiration status of perks in past months was displayed in the wrong tense (e.g., "Expires next month" for a past month).
* **"Welcome Back" Snackbar Fix:** The "Welcome Back" message that appears after using a partner app will now display correctly and will no longer be hidden behind the navigation bar.
* **Visual Glitch Squashing:** We've resolved various visual bugs, including text getting cut off, inconsistent spacing, animation jitters, and elements not aligning correctly.
* **Performance Optimizations:** We've made several under-the-hood improvements to make the app faster and more responsive, especially on the dashboard.
* **Database Migration & Fixes:** We've successfully migrated our card data to a new database and fixed several bugs related to how redemption data is saved, resulting in more reliable data loading.
* **Duplicate Button Press Prevention:** We've added a safeguard to prevent accidental double-taps when opening a partner app.

## System Architecture

Credify is built on a modern, scalable, and serverless architecture. The system is designed for security, real-time data synchronization, and robust performance.

```mermaid

    subgraph "Client (React Native)"
        A[React Native App]
    end

    subgraph "Backend (Supabase)"
        B(Supabase Auth)
        C(Supabase DB/Postgres)
        D[Supabase Edge Functions]
    end

    subgraph "Third-Party Services"
        E(OpenAI API)
        F(Sentry)

    A -- "Error Reporting" --> F
    D -- "Processes queries, calls OpenAI" --> E
    E -- "Returns AI response" --> D
    D -- "Streams response to client" --> A
```

## AI-Powered RAG & Prompt Engineering

The core of Credify's intelligence lies in a sophisticated, two-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This system is designed to provide highly accurate, context-aware, and cost-effective recommendations by minimizing token usage and maximizing the relevance of the data sent to the LLM.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Client (React Native)"
        A[User Query] --> B{Stage 1: Local Pre-Filtering};
        B -- "Filter & Rank Perks<br/>(Fuse.js)" --> C{Context Compression};
        C -- "Create Minified JSON<br/>(Lean Context)" --> D[Call Supabase Edge Function];
        G{Parse Structured JSON} --> H[Render Dynamic UI];
    end

    subgraph "Backend"
        E(OpenAI API) -- "Returns Structured<br/>JSON Response" --> F[Supabase Edge Function];
    end

    D -- "Execute Structured Prompt<br/>with Lean Context" --> E;
    F -- "Stream Response to Client" --> G;
```

### Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

The system's reliability hinges on advanced prompt engineering, which forces the LLM to act as a predictable, structured data source.

-   **Strict JSON Output:** The prompt commands the model to return **only a single, minified JSON object**. This output is governed by a rigid schema, ensuring that the response can be reliably parsed and rendered in the UI without unexpected formatting errors.
-   **Multi-Step Logic Injection:** The prompt defines a clear, 3-step prioritization logic (1. Category Match, 2. Urgency, 3. Value) that the LLM must follow. This offloads complex business logic into the prompt itself, ensuring consistent and high-quality sorting of recommendations.
-   **Dynamic Personalization & Formatting:** The AI is instructed to generate personalized `displayText` tailored to the user's query (e.g., mentioning "Chicago" if the user asks about a trip there). It is also required to use Markdown for bolding key entities, which the app then renders natively.
-   **Cost & Latency Optimization:**
    -   If the initial local filtering returns no relevant perks, **no API call is made**, saving costs and providing an instant response.
    -   The context sent to the AI is heavily minified (e.g., `cardName` becomes `cn`, `remainingValue` becomes `rv`), drastically reducing the token count for both the prompt and completion, which directly lowers API costs and improves latency.
