# Profile Enhancement Roadmap

## Overview
Enhancing the profile screen with personalized features using existing database and data sources. **No database schema changes required.**

## Available Data Sources
- `perk_redemptions` table: redemption history, values, dates, categories
- `user_credit_cards` table: card portfolio, annual fees, activity status  
- `benefit_definitions` table: perk categories, merchant names, values
- AsyncStorage: behavioral patterns, onboarding progress, interaction preferences

## Implementation Notes

### Avoiding Redundancy Strategy:
1. **Profile vs Insights Page:**
   - Profile: Personal stats, achievements, quick wins
   - Insights: Detailed analytics, trends, card performance

2. **Profile vs Existing Reminders:**
   - Profile: Achievement notifications, milestone alerts
   - Reminders: Perk expiry, renewal notifications

3. **Data Utilization:**
   - Leverage existing hooks: `usePerkStatus`, `useUserCards`
   - Extend existing utils: add `personalization.ts`
   - Build on current patterns: similar to dashboard metrics

### Technical Approach:
- Create reusable achievement calculation utilities
- Implement caching for performance
- Use existing design system components
- Follow current app architectural patterns
